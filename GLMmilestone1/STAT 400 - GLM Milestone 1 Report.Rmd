## Research Question
The goal of this logistic regression project is to predict if a team in the National Basketball Association (NBA) will make the playoffs.

## Dataset Description

NOTE: We created the cleaned dataset `NBAGameData` above based on the below raw datasets

The main raw dataset that our team chose is located at: <https://github.com/NocturneBear/NBA-Data-2010-2024/blob/main/regular_season_totals_2010_2024.csv>

It includes many teams statistics for each NBA team, however, notably missing from this dataset is whether a team made the playoffs.

This is the main response variable so this was added through data located at: <https://basketball.realgm.com/nba/playoffs/history/2010>

For the code that we created for making the cleaned dataset `NBAGameData`, please see <https://github.com/LoyalParrot/STAT_400-Final_Project/blob/main/GLMmilestone1/DatasetCreation.Rmd>.

A single observation in this dataset will be a NBA team during a given season.

## Variable Description

### Response Variable

The response variable is `PlayoffAppearanceIndicator` which is a binary indicator variable with a value of 1 for if a team made the playoffs in a the specified season and 0 otherwise.
