Our goal of this logistic regression is to predict whether a team will make the playoffs and as such our response variable will be a binary response which takes values of (1) for a team that made the playoffs and (0) for a team that did not make the playoffs.

A single observation in this dataset will be a NBA team during a given season.

## FRONT MATTER
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# link to the raw data -> https://github.com/NocturneBear/NBA-Data-2010-2024/blob/main/regular_season_totals_2010_2024.csv

NBAGameData <- read.csv() # fill in with your own file path

NBATeamData <- NBAGameData %>%
  # grouped by season and team so each observation is a team in a given season
  group_by(SEASON_YEAR,TEAM_NAME) %>%
  ## We will have to make our own summary statistics, I included FGA per game and FGM per game as an example, but we can make whatever stats we want with the given game totals
  summarise(fga = mean(FGA),
            fgm = mean(FGM))
            
```
