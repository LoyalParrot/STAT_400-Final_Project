## Dataset Choice

The dataset that our group chose for the MLM portion of the project is Dataset 1 (Education Related).

This dataset is from Kaggle and is titled *Predict Test Scores of students*.

You may find the dataset online at the following link: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kwadwoofosu/predict-test-scores-of-students/data>

```{r}
glimpse(testScores)
```

The Kaggle page already has descriptions for the data so I shall simply copy paste it here for reference.

`school` - Name of the school the student is enrolled in - Categorical, 23 Levels

`school_setting` - The location of the school - Categorical, 3 Levels

`school_type` - The type of school. Either public or non-public - Categorical, 2 Levels

`classroom` - The type of classroom - Categorical, 97 Levels

`teaching_method` - Teaching methods: Either experimental or Standard - Categorical, 2 Levels

`n_student` - Number of students in the class - Quantitative

`student_id` - A unique ID for each student - Categorical, 2133 Levels

`gender` - The gender of the students: male or female - Categorical, 2 Levels

`lunch` - Whether a student qualifies for free/subsidized lunch or not - Categorical, 2 Levels

`pretest` - The pretest score of the students out of 100 - Quantitative

`posttest` - The posttest scores of the students out of 100 - Quantitative

## Research Question

The research question that our group asks is what is the association between a classes's teaching_method and their student's post test scores, controlling for the student's pretest.

## Response

The response variable is the `posttest` score.

## Level 1 Observational Units

The Level 1 Observational Units are the individual students

## Level 2 Observational Units

The Level 2 Observational Units in our question are the individual classrooms

## Level 1 Variables

The Level 1 Variables are: `pretest`, and `posttest`.

## Level 2 Variables

The Level 2 Variables are: `teaching_method`.

## Fixed Effects

The fixed effects for our research question are: `teaching_method` and `pretest`

## Random Effects

The random effects for our research question are: the classroom.
